/*
The components in the ../Components directory collect together all of the motors, 
sensors and other mechanisms of the robot. This have to be modified accordingly 
to the engineering of the robot. And can be paired nicely with the RobotModel, 
where all of the components are initialised and can be used in RoadRunner or FTC navigation 
to make code more readable and easy to use.
Credit goes once again to Erik.
